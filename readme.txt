Before using this program, ensure that:
- 100worst.txt
- client.py
- client.sh
- server.py
- server.sh
are in the same directory.

To use this program, start the server by executing the server.sh file.
The console that appears will notify you when the server is online/ready.

To make a search, execute the client.sh file. In the console that appears,
you will be prompted to enter an artists' name. Type in the name and press Enter.
If the name has matches on the server, both the artist and their respective songs
will be retrieved.
You will then be prompted to quit. Press Enter to quit.
You can also force quit either program at any time, using Ctrl+C.

Note that depending on your system, you may find that Ctrl+C will immediately
terminate the program. This may cause some inconsistencies, such as more/less
messages being printed to the console/server log. 

For best results, please delete/clear the log files before swapping operating systems.
